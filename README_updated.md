# Quantitative Risk & Fixed Income Projects

This repository showcases a suite of quantitative finance projects focused on multi-asset risk analysis, non-parametric fixed-income risk modeling, and bond pricing via simulation and factor modeling. These implementations reflect practical quantitative techniques applicable to risk management, fixed income analytics, and quantitative research.

## üìå Project 1: Multi-Asset Portfolio Risk Analysis

**Objective:**  
Construct and analyze three equity-based portfolios (Value, Growth, Industrial ETFs) using 10 distinct Value-at-Risk (VaR) methodologies and evaluate their statistical properties and coherence.

**Key Features:**
- Portfolios: 10-stock equal-weighted compositions based on investment styles.
- Risk Models:
  - Parametric Normal VaR
  - Historical Simulation
  - Monte Carlo Simulation
  - GARCH-based VaR
  - Filtered Historical Simulation
  - Extreme Value Theory (EVT)
  - Cornish-Fisher Expansion
  - Kernel Density Estimation
  - Bootstrapped VaR
  - Student‚Äôs t-distribution VaR
- Additional Metrics:
  - Expected Shortfall (ES)
  - Sharpe and Sortino Ratios
  - Maximum Drawdown, Conditional Drawdown at Risk (CDaR)
- Statistical Testing:
  - Normality (Shapiro-Wilk, KS Test)
  - Stationarity and Autocorrelation
- Coherent Risk Measure Validation (Monotonicity, Sub-additivity, etc.)

üìà *Deliverables include documented Python notebooks, statistical diagnostics, and performance visualizations.*

## üìå Project 2: Python Library for Non-Parametric Risk in Fixed-Income

**Objective:**  
Develop a Python module for estimating non-parametric risk measures‚ÄîVaR, ES, EVT‚Äîfor both single bonds and fixed-income portfolios without assuming return distributions.

**Key Components:**
- `FixedIncomeNprmSingle` class:
  - Quantile- and bootstrap-based VaR/ES.
  - EVT estimation using Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD).
- `FixedIncomeNprmPort` class:
  - Aggregates multi-asset fixed-income portfolios.
  - Marginal VaR per position using sensitivity approximations.
- Modular Design:
  - Input validation functions (`inputsControlFunctions.py`)
  - Custom loss functions and EVT optimizers (`SupportFunctions.py`)
- Fully tested on simulated and historical bond return data.

üîß *Designed for portfolio risk managers seeking robust, distribution-free methods in fixed income.*

## üìå Project 3: Bond Pricing via Simulation and Factor Modeling

**Objective:**  
Implement and compare various bond pricing models using Monte Carlo simulations, interest rate factor models, and credit spread modeling.

**Techniques Covered:**
- Short-rate models and term structure simulation
- Bond price sensitivity to macroeconomic and yield curve factors
- Yield-to-Maturity (YTM), Duration, and Convexity analysis
- Credit risk adjustment using empirical spreads
- Risk-neutral pricing of defaultable bonds
- Visualization of yield curves and forward rates

üß† *This module emphasizes dynamic pricing of fixed-income securities and builds intuition for both credit and interest rate risk.*
